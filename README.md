Aim Lab 3DThis project is a 3D aim training game developed using Python and the OpenGL library. It provides a configurable environment for players to practice and improve their aiming skills with various game modes and visual challenges.üöÄ FeaturesMultiple Game Modes: Choose from different training scenarios:Normal: A standard mode with fixed-duration targets.Endless: Targets appear faster and have a shorter lifespan as the game progresses.Time Trial: Race against the clock, earning bonus time for each successful hit. Targets also shrink over time.Precision: Targets have a smaller "headshot" zone for bonus points, rewarding accuracy.Configurable Sessions: Set the duration of your training session (15s, 30s, 1m, 2m).Dynamic Visuals:Toggle horizontal oscillation for moving targets (M key).Enable a pulsing glow effect on targets (G key).Performance Tracking: At the end of each session, view a detailed summary including your score, accuracy, shots fired, and mode-specific statistics like headshot accuracy.3D Environment: A fully rendered 3D arena provides depth and a realistic training space.Responsive Camera Controls: Move freely within the arena and adjust your field of view (FOV).üõ†Ô∏è Installation & SetupTo run this project, you need Python and the PyOpenGL library installed.Ensure Python is installed. You can download it from python.org.Install the necessary libraries:pip install PyOpenGL PyOpenGL_accelerate
On some systems, you may also need to install freeglut.For Debian/Ubuntu: sudo apt-get install freeglut3-devFor Fedora: sudo dnf install freeglut-develFor Windows: You may need to find appropriate binaries or use a package manager like Chocolatey.üéÆ How to PlayRun the script:python 11_project.py
